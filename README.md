# shotgun-java
Shotgun-java is is small java frontend wich should help you to manipulte data (i.e. pictured)

It is based on https://github.com/mcarden/shotgun but written in java.

You can choose the file you want to manipulate with the fileChooser. The new file will be written at the same place where the origin file is lying, but the word 'broken' is added to the filename.
